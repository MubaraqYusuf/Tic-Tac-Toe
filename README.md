## 🧩 Game Logic Overview

The game board is a **3×3 grid**.  
Each move checks for:
- **Win condition**
- **Draw condition**
- **Next player’s turn**

The AI follows a **priority-based decision tree**:
1. Try to **win**  
2. **Block** opponent’s win  
3. Take **center**  
4. Take **corner**  
5. Pick **random cell**

Scores and turns are handled automatically by `game.js` and saved with `storage.js`.
